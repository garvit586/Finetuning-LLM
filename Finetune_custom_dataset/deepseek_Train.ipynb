      "Now, I need to identify the key-value pairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with UNLADING_PORT: It's at the beginning, \"Southampton, United Kingdom\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, HTS_NUMBER: I'm not sure what HTS stands for here, but looking at the example, it's the number after UNLADING_PORT. Wait, in the example, HTS_NUMBER was \"9403.60\", which seems to be the HS code. In this new input, I see \"5,540.00 kg\" and \"11,056.00 kg\". Maybe HTS_NUMBER refers to the HS code. Let me check the document. There's \"CML Grandsight Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. ( PREPAYMENT PREPAYMENT FLXT - 2617825-3170083 FLEX - 2617825\". Wait, maybe the HS code is \"2617825\"? Or maybe \"2617825-3170083\"? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps HTS_NUMBER refers to the HTS number, which is a different code. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should look for the HS code elsewhere. Let me see if there's a line with HS CODE:... I don't see that in this input. So perhaps HTS_NUMBER is not present, or maybe it's a different value. Alternatively, maybe HTS_NUMBER is the number after the UNLADING_PORT, which is \"5,540.00 kg\" and \"11,056.00 kg\". But in the example, HTS_NUMBER was the HS code, which is a number. Here, it's a weight. Maybe HTS_NUMBER is the HS code, but I don't see it. Alternatively, maybe HTS_NUMBER is the number after the carrier's name. Let me check: \"YMMU6326692 PO PO FLEXPORT...\". Maybe \"6326692\" is the HTS_NUMBER? Or \"YMMU6326692\"? I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed and see if other keys can be mapped first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, GROSS_WEIGHT: I see \"Gross Weight\" and the value is \"399310 4017189 MBL\". Wait, MBL is thousand meters? Or maybe it's a typo. Let me see: \"399310 4017189 MBL Ref. No. Port of Unloading CY - CY 70.510 cbm 68.580 cbm\". So maybe the Gross Weight is 399310 kg? Or perhaps it's two values. The example had two weights, so maybe this input also has two. So GROSS_WEIGHT might be \"399310 kg\" and \"4017189 kg\"? But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe it's a single value. I'm a bit confused. Let me note that and proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "NUMBER_OF_PACKAGES: I see \"SLAC 197 CARTONS N / M\" and \"SLAC 1 x 40 ft HC Dry Container\". So maybe the number of packages is 197? But it's unclear.\n",

      "CONTAINER_NUMBER: There's \"TCLU8883933\" mentioned earlier. Let me check: \"CML Grandsight Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd.

      "Agent Reference Number: Not clear, but it says \"Agent Reference Number Point of Origin / FTZ Number\".\n",

Alternatively, maybe it's 399310 MBL and 4017189 MBL, but that would be in cubic meters, which doesn't make sense for weight. Maybe it's a typo, and the correct value is 399310 kg.\n",
